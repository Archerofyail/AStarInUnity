Requirements:
-	   Create a scene with a floor, a number of walls and a path network.

-          Add at least two seekers that wander randomly along the path network. They do not need to have collision.

-	   When a seeker gets within range of the player (try 20 units) and has a line of sight it will alert the other seekers. 
	   The other seekers will then move toward the seeker that first spotted the player. 

-          Display the time in the tip left corner of the screen. The time increments as long as the player does not get captured. 
	   As soon as the player is captured the time stops incrementing and the final time is displayed for the player.

Extras:
-	   Add a sprint for the player that increases the speed slightly for a limited time.

-	   When a seeker loses the player it will move toward the last known location of the player.

Other Notes:
Probably a stupid time to use it, but the seekers use A* to find a random node. To use it, all you need are the AStarNode, Mover, and AStarGridCreator scripts, as well as the AStarNode prefab (You'll probably have to reassign the script to the prefab if you move it)
Assign the AStarGridCreator to an empty game object and place that where you want to start it (The node positions increment positively by two per square so if you want the center to be at 0,0 and the grid to be a 50x50 square, place it at -50 x, and -50 z). Then open the context menu for the grid creator script and click create grid. Then place a capsule down, attach a rigidbody and the move script, then give it an initial position and target position and change the speed and rotation speed however you like. It draws coloured rays for different things, I left an explanation at the top of the mover script.

It's not as well commented as it should be, but I don't think I'm quite done with it yet anyway.
